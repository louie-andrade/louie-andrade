- 👋 Hi, I’m @louie-andrade
- 👀 I’m interested in reconnecting with my Indigenous roots and cultural preservation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript although I'm also going back to reinforcing my understanding of HTML and CSS due to a hiatus due to work and school.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on basic app and web development projects related to Indigenous nations and culture.
- 📫 Github is the best means of communication with me. Should we need to discuss things further I may provide more personal methods.
